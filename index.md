I am a Muskoka-based professional photographer specializing in food and portrait photography. This portfolio showcases my work and my passion for creating images that are both striking and meaningful. My journey began over a decade ago with my first Nikon DSLR, sparking a dedication to the craft that continues to grow today.

Food has always been central to my life. Some of my earliest memories are of cooking with my Nonna, perfecting tomato sauce and rolling pasta on summer weekends. That same love shapes my approach to food photography, where I highlight vibrant colour, texture, and detail. My style is clean, bright, and designed to make every dish feel alive.

In portraiture, my focus is on capturing authentic character and natural beauty. Whether outdoors or in the studio, I create an environment that encourages ease and connection, allowing each person’s individuality to shine.

I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate, take on new projects, and expand my portfolio. If you are interested in working together or would like to learn more, I would be delighted to hear from you.
