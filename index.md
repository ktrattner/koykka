# Koykka Photography

I am a Toronto-based professional photographer specializing in food and portrait photography. My journey began over a decade ago with my first Nikon DSLR, sparking a passion that has grown into a dedicated craft.

Food has always been central to my life. Some of my earliest memories are of cooking with my Nonna, perfecting tomato sauce and rolling pasta on summer weekends. That same love shapes my approach to food photography, where I highlight vibrant colour, texture, and detail. My style is clean, bright, and designed to make every dish feel alive.

In portraiture, my focus is on capturing authentic character and natural beauty. Whether outdoors or in the studio, I create an environment that encourages ease and connection, allowing each person’s individuality to shine.

If you are seeking to collaborate, I would be delighted to connect.

Cheers!
